# python_zmq_example

This repo is a simplest case of the ZeroMQ example scripts deployed in docker. 

To run this:
    1. docker compose up -d 
    2. Then run the python_message.py file locally

There is a Dockerfile in the python message file--that is a redherring for now. Just run that script locally.

The future development of this repo is to get multiple languages to connect to the python zmq client
